==========================================
Deploying the DNS Cluster Add-on (Enhanced)
==========================================

This script will deploy CoreDNS for DNS-based service discovery in the Kubernetes cluster.
Enhanced features include:
1. Proactive worker node configuration validation
2. Automatic containerd and kubelet cgroup configuration fixes
3. Robust CoreDNS deployment with retry logic
4. Extended timeout and monitoring for pod startup
5. Comprehensive DNS functionality validation
6. Enhanced error handling and diagnostics

==========================================
Proactive Worker Node Configuration Validation
==========================================
Validating configuration for worker-0...
Connecting to worker-0 (20.55.241.176)...
  Checking cgroup configuration...
  ✓ Cgroup v2 detected - checking SystemdCgroup configuration
  ✓ SystemdCgroup already enabled in containerd
  ✓ cgroupDriver already set to systemd in kubelet
  Verifying services status...
  ✓ Both containerd and kubelet are active
  Checking node status in cluster...
  ✓ Node worker-0 is Ready in cluster

Validating configuration for worker-1...
Connecting to worker-1 (40.67.137.245)...
  Checking cgroup configuration...
  ✓ Cgroup v2 detected - checking SystemdCgroup configuration
  ✓ SystemdCgroup already enabled in containerd
  ✓ cgroupDriver already set to systemd in kubelet
  Verifying services status...
  ✓ Both containerd and kubelet are active
  Checking node status in cluster...
  ✓ Node worker-1 is Ready in cluster

Worker node validation completed. Proceeding with DNS deployment...

==========================================
Enhanced Cluster Readiness Verification
==========================================
Checking cluster connectivity (attempt 1/3)...
✓ Cluster is accessible
Cluster nodes:

✓ All 2 nodes are Ready

Checking if kube-system namespace exists...
✓ kube-system namespace exists

==========================================
Preparing Enhanced CoreDNS Manifest
==========================================
✓ Created enhanced CoreDNS manifest at C:\repos\kthw\scripts\12\coredns-enhanced.yaml

==========================================
Enhanced CoreDNS Deployment with Retry Logic
==========================================
Deploying CoreDNS (attempt 1/3)...

CoreDNS Deployment Summary
==========================================
Deployment completed at: 2025-07-13 19:32:57
Total deployment time: 0.84 minutes

✅ CoreDNS cluster add-on deployment SUCCESSFUL
   - 1/3 pods are ready and running
   - DNS resolution capabilities have been added to the cluster
   - Services can now be discovered using DNS names

Next steps:
   - Verify your applications can resolve service names
   - Monitor CoreDNS logs if you encounter DNS issues
   - Consider adjusting DNS configuration for specific use cases
